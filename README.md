# mDAE

This repository contains code for the paper "mDAE: modified Denoising AutoEncoder for missing data imputation" presented by Mariette Dupuy, Marie Chavent and RÃ©mi Dubois under submission for now. You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12847). 

## How does it work ? 

We propose two notebooks for the user that want to use mDAE. 

The first notebook mDAE.ipynb propose the steps to choose the best structure for the dataset chosen in UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

The second notebook mDAEversusothers.ipynb compares the capacity of mDAE to reconstruct missing data against all the methods we present in the paper.
